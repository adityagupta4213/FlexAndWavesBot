For example, using permissions, a server owner or administrator can define which people can send messages or who can delete others' content etc. Permissions can range from simple (like reading messages) to serious (like kicking or banning members) and therefore a server owner should be careful while assigning them.\n\nðŸ”¹ Roles can be used to group multiple permissions into a single, assignable property. They can also be used for simpler stuff like grouping people with similar interests (like a `rap` role in a music server) or giving colors to people's nicknames in the server.\n\nðŸ”¹ Though the ability to assign roles lies with the server owner, they can allow other trusted members to do the same by giving them the permission to give other members permissions of lower levels."
